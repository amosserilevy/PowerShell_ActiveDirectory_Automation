# PowerShell_ActiveDirectory_Automation
just automated the basic configuration for AD DC for my test.
its probably still have some bugs because it served its purpose and it's pretty self explanatory (we were moveing to the next lesson on the bootcamp), 
even more the powershell will give you an exact feedback on errors, 
it worked for me with some on the way reparing, 
if you see any bugs and want to help this code be better please notify me,
im sure it will help someone in the future :)
